# Computer-Networking-Communication
Implemented a comprehensive computer networking communication project employing TCP/UDP protocols, featuring file management functionalities. The system operates on a client-server architecture with the capability for clients to execute put, get, and quit commands. Specifically, when a client requests a file, the system checks the cache first. If the cache holds the requested file, it is promptly delivered to the client. In the absence of the file in the cache, the request is directed to the server. Upon retrieval from the server, the cache stores a copy for future requests, optimizing response times. Additionally, the project supports the put method, allowing clients to upload files to the server, and the quit method for terminating communication. This multifaceted approach not only enhances client satisfaction and reduces server load but also contributes to increased efficiency in file retrieval operations while offering flexibility for file uploads and graceful communication termination.
